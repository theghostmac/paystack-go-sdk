# UPCOMING CHANGES

## TODO:
- [ ] Write reusable functions to reduce repetition.
- [ ] Convert every function to method under their respective structs.
- [ ] Confirm whether SK test keys return auth code after initializing and verifying transactions: `Email does not match Authorization code. Authorization may be inactive or belong to a different email. Please confirm.`
- [ ] Create Bulk methods for some specific functions, to allow backend devs do things in batches.
- [ ] Some tests are `t.Skip`'ed, because they were not passing. Look into the functions and tests.
